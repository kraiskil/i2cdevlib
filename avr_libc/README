This is a platform implementation for AVR using avr-libc only, without
any Arduino SW/system libraries.

Add 
- avr_libc/I2Cdev/I2Cdev.cpp
- avr_libc/I2Cdev/avr_libc_i2cdev.cpp
to your project sources.

Also add
- avr_libc/ardiuno.c
if you want to use device drivers in the Arduino/ folder.

Notes:
I2Cdev.cpp is generic (platform independant) parts of I2Cdev.cpp files
found in other parts of this source tree. As such, there is code duplication: beware 
of bugs fixed in the other I2Cdev.cpp files!
